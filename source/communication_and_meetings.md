# Lab communication

## In person meetings

### Individual meetings

- Mondays, every week, scheduled via Outlook calendar
- Prepare in advance
  - What are upcoming events (2-3 months; e.g. committee meeting, conference, meetings with collaborators)
  - Progress and results
  - Other activities (including non-scientific like courses attended, tutorials, infrastructure)
  - Next goals (list next steps in research and what tasks are needed to accomplish them)
  - Roadblocks/needs (list critical needs that are/you anticipate are blocking progress - especially things you need Andre to do. e.g. setup a VM, learn about a framework, download lots of data, more space in cluster)
  - Literature (indicate a paper you found interesting/relevant that Andre should read or that should be discussed in a journal club)
  - The above can be shared with Andre in advance (e.g. in a markdown file)
- The meta layer / check-in:
  - Talk about how you are doing, progress, frustration, goals beyond research
  - Once per month, more often if needed
- The scheduled meetings should not prevent you from reaching out to Andre at any time if needed (in person, via email, chat, phone)!

### Lab meetings

- Tuesdays, early week (12:30)
- Schedule:
  - The schedule for the presentations is set by Andre and available [here](https://cemmat.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/rendeirolab/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCA81B64C-2577-459B-BCAB-89C6678B342B%7D).
- Format:
  - Housekeeping (announcements, scheduling)
    - Any update relevant to the lab by anyone
  - Quick round reviewing week progress (20 min max, 3-5 min per person):
    - What did you try to achieve? (broadly and specifically)
    - What were the challenges?
  - One or more scheduled presentations (20-30 min) including:
    - Scientific question/hypothesis
    - Background (what has been done/can we build on)
    - Approach/methodology
    - Results
    - Outlook/next steps

### Code review

- Every 2 weeks (to begin, then maybe more sparse)
- 1h30 to 2h00 duration
- The goal is to improve everyone's programming skills/process - not shaming!
- Typical workflow:
  - Nominate one script/function to study (e.g. caused problems or is inefficient, not Pythonic, etc...) OR ask Andre before hand to look at a repository to select one piece of code to focus on.
  - Ideally only 200-400 lines of code at one time
  - Everyone studies the goals of the code and the implementation
  - Together try to assess:
    1. Readability and documentation
    1. Architecture
    1. Re-usability
    1. Additional: packaging, speed, security, etc...
  - End by highlighting one new Github repository that you find cool/useful for the group - everyone quickly installs and explore
  - Occasionally/alternatively we can talk about the meta part: cluster issues, installation, text editors, .bashrc setup, etc...

### Strategic collaborative projects (SCPs)

- Everyone is encouraged to participate in more than one depending on interest/relevance
- SCP2: Aging & longevity:
  - One meeting per month
  - Two organizers (generally from De Rooij and Rendeiro labs)
  - Mailing list: scp2@cemmat.onmicrosoft.com
  - Send papers with the usual format/tag in subject: `[paper] <title>`, and body: `<title> \n <url> \n <comment>`

### Hackatons

- one afternoon every 2-3 months
- ideas:
  - CeMMome (involve more people?):
    1. Literature mining: papers, research reports, press releases
    1. Friday seminar audio transcription
    1. Data Science:
    1. What topics are there at CeMM?
    1. How did they evolve over time?
    1. Individuals:
  - Configuring "hilde"
  - Lab website
  - Deep learning basics
  - AI art
  - ...

### Yearly kick start/team building meeting

- Topics:
  - Values
  - Personality
  - Motivation
  - Feedback
  - Goals and expectations
  - Research integrity
  - Jointly write a Code of Conduct
- Revisit yearly or when new members joint

See also the "asking questions" section on [the learning note](learning.md).

## Messaging

Use the lab's mailing list (rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at) for searchable, archivable content (announcements, scheduling, papers).

Use Microsoft Teams for non-archival content (curiosities, non-urgent questions, fun stuff).

Use Signal's lab group for quick messages (coordinating movement, real-time info, urgent questions, fun stuff).

## Papers

Feel free to send around any paper you find interesting or relevant.

Send it via email ([rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at](mailto:rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at)) in the following format:

- To: [rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at](mailto:rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at)
- Subject: `[paper] <title>`
- Body: `<title> \n <url> \n <comment>`

Fields with `<>` should be replaced with content.

## Lab retreats

> [!CAUTION]
> TODO

## Social meetings and celebrations

Social gatherins for example in celebrations of personal and professional achievements are welcome and encouraged.
They should however follow the guidelines and rules from CeMM.
