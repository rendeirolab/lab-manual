# Getting started

Welcome to the Rendeiro lab at CeMM!

This page is meant to help new members get started with the lab and for the PI and team to make sure onboarding is smooth.

You are at the start of an adventure, donâ€™t forget to enjoy the journey.

## Get informed

The first step is to get informed about the lab's [mission and philosophy](mission_statement.md), the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) and how we operate (rest of the manual).

Feel free to go ahead and read the [mission statement](mission_statement.md) and [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) to get started.

The rest of the content here are pointers for newcomers on practical aspects on how to get started in the lab.

## Get started

### Lab-specific

Onboarding to-dos (responsability of the PI):

1. Ask the new team member for their contact information (optional, but recommended for safety reasons) - [add your own information here](https://cemmat.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/rendeirolab/ETVfBUPmJYpIgl-yDccPCGkBZRMFtOTE9ExejqyvMq6msA?e=lxEuzO);
1. Add the new team member to lab Microsoft team and mailing list;
1. Share and introduce the lab's resources to the new team member:
   - the lab manual (this)
   - the lab code of conduct (see [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md))
   - lab infrastructure (such as Cytomine, VMs, etc: [infrastructure](infrastructure.md))
   - Github team ([https://github.com/rendeirolab](https://github.com/rendeirolab))
