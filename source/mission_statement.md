# Mission and philosophy

## Mission statement

At the Rendeiro Lab, we are committed to unraveling the complexities of human aging and pathology through the integration of computational innovation and molecular precision. As part of CeMM and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Network Medicine, our mission is to decode the architectural patterns of the human body—from cellular microenvironments to organ-wide structures—and to understand how these patterns influence health, aging, and the onset of disease. We aim to uncover the mechanisms through which cellular and tissue-level changes contribute to the progressive decline in physiological function, and to leverage this knowledge to predict disease risk, facilitate early diagnosis, and inspire transformative therapeutic strategies.

Our work is grounded in the development and application of computational methods that analyze spatial data, including digital pathology, spatial transcriptomics, and highly multiplexed imaging. By integrating these high-dimensional data streams with molecular and clinical insights across the human lifespan, we strive to answer key questions: How do cellular alterations scale to tissue dysfunction? What are the molecular underpinnings of age-related diseases? How can we differentiate between normal aging and pathology? These questions guide our efforts to generate actionable insights that bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications in healthcare.

Through close collaboration with clinicians, pathologists, and researchers across disciplines, we ensure that our findings are validated in real-world contexts. We believe that understanding the intricate connections between cellular dynamics and organ-level architecture will lead not only to better interventions for age-associated diseases but also to a deeper appreciation of the processes that sustain human life. With a commitment to innovation, collaboration, and real-world impact, the Rendeiro Lab aims to shape the future of aging and pathology research for the benefit of society.

## Philosophy

Our lab operates at the intersection of biomedicine, computational biology, and systems biology research, guided by these core principles:

- **Interdisciplinary collaboration**: We believe that tackling complex biological questions requires an interdisciplinary approach. Our team fosters collaboration across molecular medicine, computational biology, and clinical expertise to drive innovation.

- **Curiosity-driven science**: Fundamental curiosity about the human body fuels our research. We pursue questions that challenge traditional paradigms and push the boundaries of knowledge.

- **Innovation and impact**: From pioneering tissue-specific aging clocks to developing AI-driven spatial methods, we strive to create tools and insights with transformative potential for science and medicine.

- **Inclusion and mentorship**: We are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and intellectually stimulating environment. Mentorship and professional growth for all team members are central to our philosophy.

- **Reproducibility and open science**: We emphasize rigorous, reproducible research and actively contribute to open science. We aim to benefit the broader scientific community by sharing data and tools.

- **Human-centric focus**: While our methods are primarily computationally driven, our ultimate goal is to improve human health. We aim to bridge the gap between molecular and physiological insights, and real-world diagnostic, therapeutic, and clinical applications.
