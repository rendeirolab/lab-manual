# Staffing: Hiring and interviewing<a name="staffing-hiring-and-interviewing"></a>

Hiring well is the best prevention to most of the difficult situations you will encounter in your career as an independent investigator

Good employees and colleagues can be a source of support in unexpected situations. Keep in mind though, that we cannot take anything for granted in life.

A lot of work is needed to maintain a good team of employees and colleagues motivated and efficient.

You are at the start of a beautiful human adventure, don’t forget to enjoy the journey.

## Writing a job offer<a name="writing-a-job-offer"></a>

## Screening resumes<a name="screening-resumes"></a>

- Screen all the resumes yourself
- Check directly skills and qualifications against your key word list
- Carefully check experience: dates, duration, hours/week, supervisor/employer name, role, project goal
- Look for transferable skills
- Red flags: vague, poorly formatted resume, unnecessary information (minor), gaps in employment (minor), job-hopping (minor)
- Check the cover letter provided by the applicants
- Position-specific:
  - Postdocs: consider publication quality-not just quantity—and the applicant's contribution
  - 2 first-author papers are necessary to be able to obtain some competitive post-doc fellowships
  - Lab Technicians/research staff: if publications are listed, evaluate them; indicates an important (and appreciated) technical/intellectual contribution
  - Check that technical skill list matches research experience (levels of proficiency?)
  - Graduate/undergraduate students: resume should be less determinant; speak informally with other people who have worked with the student

Grades aren't a guarantee for success!

1. Send them by email a list of precise questions to answer:

- Describe the job and the work atmosphere you want to create
- Ask short, open-ended questions
- Why is this person leaving? Is he or she reliable? Would you rehire this person? What are this person’s
  strengths and weaknesses?
- What are you most pleased/disappointed in with respect to this person?
- Probe for further information, ask for examples. Do not settle for yes/no answers

## Making an offer<a name="making-an-offer"></a>

## Giving feedback to candidates<a name="giving-feedback-to-candidates"></a>

## Terminating employment<a name="terminating-employment"></a>

Before considering dismissal, be sure that you have tried various avenues to help
this person be successful in your lab
• Try to determine whether you think the person would be better off in another lab or should
consider another career
• For students and postdocs, this usually means talking with that person and his or her faculty
adviser or the graduate student committee
• It may be best to suggest to someone that research is not for them if you truly believe the
profession is not suited to his or her talents or personality
• You can provide that person with encouragement and options for other careers related (or
not) to Sciences

You should clearly outline and set expectations for the performance and conduct of everyone
in your lab:
• As early as you identify problems, start keeping a record
• Document your attempts to help the person improve his or her performance
• Deliver a warning, calmly and in private. Listen to the employee’s point of view and explanation.
Develop a plan in writing for addressing the problem with benchmarks and timelines
• Should you ultimately have to terminate this person, these records can help avert external challenges
to your decision

Consult with HR as soon as possible to ensure that you are complying with institutional and
legal requirements. Ask yourself and document each of the following actions before
proceeding:
• Have you given the person at least some type of notice or warning?
• Have you made it clear to the person what is the issue?
• Has the person received counseling or assistance in learning new or difficult tasks? If so, how much?
• Are you treating (or have you treated) the person differently from other staff in your lab?
• Are you following written procedures and institutional policies?
• Does the documentation in the personnel file support the reason for discharge
