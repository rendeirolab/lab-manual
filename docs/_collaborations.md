# Collaborations

Don't accept any collaboration without long thought on what it implies.

You have a fiduciary duty not to be involved in collaborations which will use your lab's resources unwisely or harm the lab's reputation.

Ask:
 - what do I gain from it?
 - how will my team's investment be compensated?



Ask at the get go:
 - project outline
 - experimental design: type of samples, patients, data types, number of samples, factors or interest, confounding factors
 - key biological questions asked
 - be joint last-author
 - have allocated resources in grant if submitting one
