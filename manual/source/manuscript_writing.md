# Manuscript writing

This document provides practical guidelines for writing a manuscript.
For insights on planning a project please see the [project planning guide](project_planning.md) instead.

Manuscript writing should really be called "manuscript crafting" as it involves a lot more than text writing and formatting or figure making as it takes a lot of time, effort and skill to craft a good manuscript.


## Figures

A crucial part of crafting a great manuscript is good communication of ideas through visual elements (figures), and their alignment with the text.

Here are Andre's tips for figure making based on practice.
This has changed a little over the time, but mostly coalesced on a fairly simple system.

### Making plots (Python, matplotlib, seaborn):

- Try to compartmentalize data processing from visualization (not just the early 'pipeline'-like processing, but also the analytical analysis) - but that does not mean that 
- Each script produces a set of plots into a `results` directory, with subdirectories matching the script or analysis name (more hierarchical if needed, e.g. different datasets).
- Each plot file name should be self explanatory and contain enough information to track down its origin.
- Except for obvious groupings or interrelations, avoid making figures with many subplots.
- Create figures in matplotlib/seaborn always explicitly: `fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3, 3)`
- For the most part aim for each subplot to have a square shape with about 3 by 3 inches. If creating a figure with multiple subplots, scale the figure size accordingly: `fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(2 * 3, 4 * 3)`
- Always label the axes, and make use of a single statement to set many properties at once: `ax.set(xlabel="Time", ylabel="Expression (log)", yscale="log")`
- For plot elements with many objects (e.g. scatter), rasterize that specific single element in order to reduce the size of the figure: `g = sns.clustermap(...); g.ax_heatmap.set(rasterized=True)`. Do not rasterized the whole axes as that will make e.g. text element uneditable.
- Choose consistent colors across a project. Consider thinking of all factors being highlighted in the paper before starting the project. See colormaps here: [https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html)
- Choose continuous colormaps for continuous variables (magma, viridis). Use divergent colormaps (coolwarm, RdBu_r, PuOr_r) only when a central value has meaning (e.g. a Z-score).

### Recommend settings for matplotlib

#### Inkscape: Export to SVG

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.rcParams['savefig.bbox'] = 'tight'  # To ensure that legends and elements outside the axes are included
plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 300  # To make sure any rasterized elements have good quality
plt.rcParams['savefig.transparent'] = True  # To remove the white background
plt.rcParams['svg.fonttype'] = 'none'  # To allow font to be editable in Inkscape
plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Arial'  # Use Arial as the font
```

#### Adobe Illustrator: Export to PDF

This is similar as above, except that we change the font settings,

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.rcParams['savefig.bbox'] = 'tight'
plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 300
plt.rcParams['savefig.transparent'] = True
plt.rcParams['pdf.fonttype'] = 42
plt.rcParams['ps.fonttype'] = 42
plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Arial'
```

### Assemble plots manually into a figure:

#### Inkscape

- Check the journal requirements and limitations for figures and their dimensions. Use A4 by default, not letter.
- Here is a template figure: [https://gist.github.com/afrendeiro/2d9975793629774ad73ea9d18bd7abf3](https://gist.github.com/afrendeiro/2d9975793629774ad73ea9d18bd7abf3)
- Add a plot to the canvas, resize it to an approximate desired size, remove all groupings, remove redundant objects, possibly despine plot (i.e. remove top right, top axes). Make whole plot into a group (or layer).
- Be wary of resize operations that change aspect ratio. Be sure not to create artifacts. Here's some help: [https://github.com/burghoff/Scientific-Inkscape](https://github.com/burghoff/Scientific-Inkscape) (hasn't worked recently for me).
- Use a consistent font family (Arial) for all text elements and only one or two font sizes (12 and 10). You can use the Find/Replace tool with `Object types = 'text'` to do this.
- Add a lowercase letter label to each panel (font 16).
- Add a label to the top of the Figure (i.e. Figure 1)
- Name the figure files consistently Figure1.svg, SupplementaryFigure1.svg

Post assembly, automatic assembly and conversion of file types (bash, inkscape, minify, pdfunite):

- Use script here: [https://gist.github.com/afrendeiro/a656eca139381eec55da6357e33173ce](https://gist.github.com/afrendeiro/a656eca139381eec55da6357e33173ce)
- Use generated individual PDFs to embed in a manuscript tex file.
- Use generated individual PNGs to embed in a manuscript file like docx.
- Use the joint PDFs to print, share or submit to journal.

Only in very rare cases it is worth it to have a full final figure generated as a whole.

#### Adobe Illustrator:

Open PDF in Adobe Illustrator

- Select everything:
    - Mac: <kbd>&#8984; Command</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>
    - Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>
- Go to `Object` -> `Clipping Mask` -> `Release`, press until it can't be pressed anymore:
    - Mac: <kbd>‚å• Option</kbd> + <kbd>&#8984; Command</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd>
    - Windows: <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>7</kbd>

Congratulations! Now you have a clean plot ready for editing.

> [!CAUTION]
> Removing clipping masks may affect elements, such as bars that extend offscreen.


## Text

Manuscript text is usually written in Microsoft Word (docx) or LibreOffice Writer (odt).
Latex is also supported, talk with Andre about starting with a LaTeX template.

### Formatting

Use styles to format your text. Do not use whitespace (e.g. newlines and spaces) in the text to format the document.

- Page:
    - Page size: A4
    - Page margins: 2 cm on all sides
- Styles:
    - Default text style:
        - Font: Arial
        - Font size: 11
        - Line spacing: 1.15 lines
        - Paragraph spacing: 0.2cm below paragraph, 0.0cm above paragraph
        - Alignment: Justified
        - Color: Black
    - Headings (all inherit the above default style):
        - Title: Font size: 14, bold
        - Heading 1: Font size: 12, bold, paragraph spacing: 0.4cm above
        - Heading 2: Font size: 11, italic, paragraph spacing: 0.3cm above
        - Heading 3: possible but not recommended
    - Figure legends (inherit from default style except for settings below):
        - Legend below figure.
        - Font size: 10
        - Figure number and title: bold.
