# Communication

## In person meetings

### Individual meetings
 - Mondays, every week (13:00)
 - Prepare in advance (ideally as a markdown file that you share with Andre):
	 - What are upcoming events (2-3 months; e.g. committee meeting, conference, meetings with collaborators)
	 - Progress and results
	 - Other activities (including non-scientific like courses attended, tutorials, infrastructure)
	 - Next goals (list next steps in research and what tasks are needed to accomplish them)
	 - Roadblocks/needs (list critical needs that are/you anticipate are blocking progress - especially things you need Andre to do. e.g. setup a VM, learn about a framework, download lots of data, more space in cluster)
	 - Literature (indicate a paper you found interesting/relevant that Andre should read or that should be discussed in a journal club)
 - The meta layer / Check-in:
	 - Talk about how you are doing, progress, frustration, goals beyond research
	 - Once per month, more often if needed
	 - Should we do a separate meeting or is it alright to have together with the individual ones?
 - The scheduled meetings should not prevent you from reaching out to Andre at any time if needed (in person, via email, chat, phone)!

### Lab meetings
- Thursdays, early week (13:00)
- Format:
  - Housekeeping (announcements, scheduling)
  - Quick round reviewing week progress:
    - What did you try to achieve?
    - What were the challenges?
  - One presentation including:
    - Scientific question/hypothesis
    - Background (what has been done/can we build on)
    - Approach/methodology
    - Results
    - Outlook/next steps

### Code review
- Every 2 weeks (to begin, then maybe more sparse)
- 1h30 to 2h00 duration
- The goal is to improve everyone's programming skills/process - not shaming!
- Typical workflow:
	- Nominate one script/function to study (e.g. caused problems or is inefficient, not Pythonic, etc...) OR ask Andre before hand to look at a repository to select one piece of code to focus on.
	- Ideally only 200-400 lines of code at one time
	- Everyone studies the goals of the code and the implementation
	- Together try to assess:
		1. Readability and documentation
		2. Architecture
		3. Re-usability
		4. Additional: packaging, speed, security, etc...
	 - End by highlighting one new Github repository that you find cool/useful for the group - everyone quickly installs and explore
	 - Occasionally/alternatively we can talk about the meta part: cluster issues, installation, text editors, .bashrc setup, etc...

### Strategic collaboratite projects (SCPs)
- Everyone is encouraged to participate in more than one depending on interest/relevance
- Aging & longevity SCP:
  - One meeting per month
	- Two organizers (maybe from De Rooij and Rendeiro labs)
	- Mailing list: aging@cemmat.onmicrosoft.com
	- Send papers with the usual format/tag: `[paper]`

### Hackatons
- one afternoon every 2-3 months (start last week January?)
- ideas:
	- CeMMome (involve more people?):
		1. Literature mining: papers, research reports, press releases
		2. Friday seminar audio transcription
		3. Data Science:
			1. What topics are there at CeMM?
			2. How did they evolve over time?
			3. Individuals:
	 - Configuring "hilde"
	 - Lab website
	 - Deep learning basics
	 - AI art
	 - 

### Yearly kick start/team building meeting
- Topics:
	- Values
	- Personality
	- Motivation
	- Feedback
	- Goals and expectations
	- Research integrity
	- Jointly write a Code of Conduct
- Revisit yearly or when new members joint

## Messaging

Use the lab's mailing list (rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at) for searchable, archivable content (announcements, scheduling, papers).

Use Microsoft Teams for non-archival content (curiosities, non-urgent questions, fun stuff).

Use Signal's lab group for quick messages (coordinating movement, real-time info, urgent questions, fun stuff).

## Papers

Feel free to send around any paper you find interesting or relevant.

Send it via email (rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at) in the following format:
 - To: rendeirogroup@int.cemm.at
 - Subject: [paper] <title>
 - Body:
    <title>
    <url>
    <comment>
Fields with `<>` should be replaced with content.
